## Media 

### ü©∫ 1. Media scripts humans in ways we don't fully appreciate. 

* Subjects at the mercy of the journalist. "dark arts", e.g asking for a comment 20min before the piece is published, or picking quotes without context.
* Journalists at the mercy of the corporation they work for.
* "Never argue with the man who buys ink by the barrel" - Roger Branigin. 
* üìó On the dark arts of journalism & its structural incentives: ["The Journalist and the Murderer"](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/106480/the-journalist-and-the-murderer-by-janet-malcolm/) from ex-New Yorker writer [Janet Malcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Malcolm). 

### ü©∫ 2. Media incentives are based on pageviews, prestige and profit.

* Pageviews: benefit from polarisation. 
* "If it bleeds it leads". "If it enrages it engages". 
* "Scissor statements" - obviously true to one party, and obviously false to the other 
* Prestige: popularity among the establishment. Going for Pulitzers. Small group of people who clap eachother. 
Profit: conflict and crisis leads to more subscriptions bought. William Randolph Hearst 

### ‚úåÔ∏è 3. We need radical decentralisation: citizen journalism not corporate journalism. 

* Citizens who know more about the field they're writing about and whose "sense of self" isn't just tied to writing.
* Have independent confirmations on the data (similar to blockchains) not just one source of truth.

### ‚úå 4. Modes of defence against media attacks

* Personal financial independence: you are free to speak your mind.
* Collective independence: you have reduced vulnerabilities from your associations to other organisations.  
Work in the pseudonymous economy: protection by keeping your real world identity secret.

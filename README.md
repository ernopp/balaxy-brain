## Media 

### ü©∫ 1. Media scripts humans in ways we don't fully appreciate 

* **Subjects at the mercy of the journalist**. "dark arts", e.g asking for a comment 20min before the piece is published, or picking quotes without context
* **Journalists at the mercy of the corporation** they work for.
* *"Never argue with the man who buys ink by the barrel"* - Roger Branigin 
* üìó ["*The Journalist and the Murderer*"](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/106480/the-journalist-and-the-murderer-by-janet-malcolm/) on the dark arts of journalism & its structural incentives, from ex-New Yorker writer [Janet Malcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Malcolm) 

### ü©∫ 2. Media incentives are based on pageviews, prestige and profit

* **Pageviews**: benefit from polarisation
  * "If it bleeds it leads". "If it enrages it engages". 
  * "Scissor statements" - designed to inflict controversy, e.g obviously true to one party, and obviously false to the other 
* **Prestige**: popularity among the establishment. Going for Pulitzers. Small group of people who clap eachother. 
* **Profit**: conflict and crisis leads to more subscriptions bought. William Randolph Hearst 

### ‚úåÔ∏è 3. We need citizen journalism not corporate journalism 

* Citizens who know more about the field they're writing about and whose "sense of self" isn't just tied to writing
* Have independent confirmations on the data (similar to blockchains - everyone knows how much BTC someone has) not just one source of truth

### ‚úå 4. Modes of defence against media attacks

* **Personal financial** independence: you are free to speak your mind
* **Collective independence**: you have reduced vulnerabilities from your associations to other organisations
* **Work in the pseudonymous economy**: protection by keeping your real world identity secret

"You need to achieve financial independence
in order to achieve ideological independence
in order to achieve collective independence."

## Institutions

### ü©∫Inherited institutions 

* "East Coast" institutions select a new leader through inheritance, either from parent to child, e.g WSJ (Murdochs), NYT (Sulzbergers), or as a political heir
* Selected for legitimacy"Most folks who assume political office in the modern US do not have the skills to organize anything like the Federal Reserve or the US Military from scratch, unlike George Washington or Alexander Hamilton"
* TODO https://1729.com/founding-vs-inheriting/
* TODO https://tim.blog/2021/03/25/balaji-srinivasan-transcript/

### Regulatory Capture

* Coronation disguised as regulation. See the making of the "Big Four" bank oligopoly [here](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-banking-oligopoly-in-one-chart/). 

### ü©∫Scientific institutions

* People were shouting ‚Äúmasks don‚Äôt work because of science‚Äù or ‚Äúmasks work because of science‚Äù
* They were actually repeating what they heard from some authority figure

### ‚úå Network State

* Crypto is not only the next Wall Street. It is also the next Silicon Valley, the next Yale School of Law, and Columbia School of Journalism

## Geopolitics

### 1. ü©∫ American decline

* The decline in American state capacity

### China, India

### 1. India as the "dark horse" of this decade.

* Rise in state capacity, like China
* ‚Äú2000s were the tech companies, 2010s the crypto protocols, 2020s startup cities and 2030s network states‚Äù
* How India created a digital blueprint for the economies of the future

## Technological Progressivism

Disciplines & topics encompassing the **technological progressivism movement**: cryptocurrencies, startup cities, mathematics, transhumanism, space travel, reversing aging. 

Memes as the lingua-france of the internet

### ‚úå The Network State
* Rather than taking over a physical area, you build a community of technology progressives on the cloud

What if the new "techno-utopist" world isn't as good for people?

The theory is that if you have N opt-in societies that start with zero people, and are free to attract citizens from the old world, some of them will outcompete the old world.

The best may be very much better. And the worst likely won't attract many citizens in the first place.
